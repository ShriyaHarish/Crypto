         <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography,
             which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
              Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger 
              enforced by a disparate network of computers.</p>
